**NOTE:** this project was a Proof of Concept only. If you are looking for an AAC decoder library which you would like to use in your own projects, then please visit the follow-up project http://code.google.com/p/aacdecoder-android/.

Please see also my [blog](http://vaclavb.blogspot.com/2010/06/raw-aac-player-for-android.html).

This is a port of the following open source libraries to Android platform:
  * [FAAD2](http://www.audiocoding.com/) (Freeware Advanced Audio (AAC) Decoder including SBR decoding)
  * [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org) library (only AAC decoder)
  * [OpenCORE aacdec](http://code.google.com/p/opencore-aacdec/) library

This project was written for those developers spending hours of googling the internet to answer a simple question:
> How to make Android to **play raw AAC files (streams)** ?

I spent many hours by it and now I want to save other people's time - so I am publishing what I have found.

I tried to:
  * invoke `MediaPlayer` on raw AAC `http://` URL (error)
  * invoke `MediaPlayer` on raw AAC file (error in emulator, OK on HTC Desire)
  * pass a `NetSocket` `FileHandle` to `MediaPlayer` (error)
  * filter the stream using local `ServerSocket` and:
    * discard HTTP header (error)
    * change content-type to several possibilities like audio/mpeg (error)
    * sync ADTS header (icecast does not do it) (error)
  * split the AAC stream into small file chunks (OK, but not excellent)
  * use 3rd party native libraries (FAAD2/FFmpeg) to decode AAC (OK on HTC Desire, working on emulator - but slow)
  * finally using the 3rd party library **OpenCORE aacdec** met the expectations - and playing is smooth even on emulator
